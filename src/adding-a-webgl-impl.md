- It's an API for drawing primitives (points, lines, triangles)
- Make up a Geometry out of Vertices
- Pass Data into Shaders
- Triangulate Vertices in a Vertex Shader
- Rasterize the shape (figure out the pixels which need to be rendered)
- Calculate colors of each Pixel inside a shape (Fragment Shader)
