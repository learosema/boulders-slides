- Same concepts apply as in WebGL
- Both APIs have attributes (pull data from a buffer into a vertex shader)
- Both APIs have uniforms (shared variables passed to shaders)
- Both APIs have varyings (pass data from a vertex shader to a fragment shader and interpolate between values)
- Both APIs have textures (ways to provide 2D or 3D data)
- Both APIs provide ways to render to textures
